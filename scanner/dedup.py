"""
Dedup engine.

Two distinct bugs this exists to fix:

1. Exact duplicates: the same (file, line, rule_id) emitted twice (e.g. a
   generic catch-all rule re-firing on a call site a specific rule already
   covered, or any accidental double-emission in an analyzer). Collapsed to one.

2. Generic-vs-specific overlap: a specific rule ("aes-hardcoded-key",
   "md5-weak-password-hash", "insecure-rng", ...) and a generic catch-all rule
   ("aes-encryption", "md5-hashing") both fire on the same call site. The
   generic one is suppressed - most-specific-rule-wins, one finding per
   (file, line, call-site) unless the findings represent genuinely distinct
   vulnerability classes on the same line (e.g. hardcoded-key AND
   missing-aead on one call - both are kept, since both are real, different,
   independently-fixable issues; only the *generic* AES-encryption note is
   redundant once either fires).
